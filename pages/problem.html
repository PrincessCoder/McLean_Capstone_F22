        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
            The current lack of information results in ambivalence toward the pollination garden.</p>

<p>By welcoming visitors, there is an opportunity to provide information and entertainment while visitors wait for the museum to open or rest from a walk on the adjacent trail.</p>

<!-- <p>The Neville Public Museum has an annual attendance of xxx visitors annually. During the summer months of June, July and August the attendance averages xxx per day. In addition to the pollination garden at the entrance of the museum, there is also a bee pollination exhibit on display a few steps away, inside the doors. The pollination garden is an outdoor classroom representing science in action.</p> -->

<p>The garden lacks a welcoming point of interaction.
There currently is no exhibit way-finding
Language options and accessibility could be improved
Identification of plants is currently close to the ground and not in one central location</p>

<h4>Everybody deals with constraints and these are ours.</h4>

<p>Grandparents, grandchildren, and everyone in between visit the Brown County Neville Public Museum. The museum makes every effort to offer inclusive experiences to all who engage with the exhibits, regardless of abilities or technology access. A wide age and ability range is one challenge.</p>

<p>Visitors speaking various languages and guests with accessibility needs are common at the museum. It is essential to the staff and the foundation board that visitors enjoy exhibits in many ways. When we design for accessibility, we enhance the experience for all.</p>

<h4>What outcomes do we want to see?</h4>

<p>The predicted outcome we are designing for — engagement and conversation both in the garden and inside the museum.</p>

<h3>increased engagement</h3>
<p>An interactive app designed to entertain and educate visitors of all ages, and a plant and pollinator information kiosk at the garden's edge. These tools will be used to increase engagement in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Purchase garden starter kits, to start a home garden</li>
<li>Encourage visitors seeking more information to connect with the UW-Extension Master Gardners Program of Brown County</li>
<li>Schedule volunteer groups to help with maintenance of the garden</li>
<li>Educate and entertain in the pollination garden</li>
</ul>
<h3>Increased conversation</h3>


<p>Providing opportunities for conversation both at the museum and throughout the community.</p>

<h4>What does success look like?</h4>

<h3>Everybody wants to win, here is how we define success</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Curious visitors</li>
    <li>increased attendance</li>
    <li>A healthy garden</li>
    <li>#social media likes, shares and posts</li>
    <li>Requests for more information</li>
    <li>Community partnerships</li>
</ul>
